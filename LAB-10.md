# Photo Forensics Practical Guide

## Introduction
Photo forensics involves the examination and analysis of digital images to determine their authenticity and gather insights. This guide covers practical techniques for conducting photo forensics.

### Visual Inspection
- **Objective:** Identify anomalies or irregularities visible to the naked eye.

#### Steps:
1. Open the image using a reliable image viewer.
2. Inspect for any signs of manipulation, such as inconsistent lighting, shadows, or artifacts.

### Error-Level Analysis
- **Objective:** Detect areas of an image with different error levels, indicating potential alterations.

#### Steps:
1. Use an error-level analysis tool like [FotoForensics](https://fotoforensics.com/).
2. Upload the image and analyze the error level map.
3. Identify regions with significant differences in error levels, suggesting potential tampering.

### Noise Analysis
- **Objective:** Examine the noise patterns within an image.

#### Steps:
1. Utilize a noise analysis tool like [Image Noise Analyzer](https://www.imageforensic.org/).
2. Analyze the image's noise patterns.
3. Look for irregularities or patterns inconsistent with the expected noise for the given image type.

### Link Analysis
- **Objective:** Establish relationships between two or more photos.

#### Steps:
1. Collect a set of photos for analysis.
2. Utilize image comparison tools like [Forensic Image Comparison Tool (FICT)](https://github.com/0ptr/forensic-image-comparison-tool) to identify similarities or shared elements.
3. Note any common features, timestamps, or metadata.

### Combined Techniques
- **Objective:** Enhance the overall authenticity determination by combining multiple techniques.

#### Steps:
1. Integrate findings from visual inspection, error-level analysis, noise analysis, and link analysis.
2. Cross-verify results to strengthen the overall assessment.

## Conclusion
Photo forensics is a multidimensional process that requires a combination of visual inspection and advanced analysis techniques. By employing a holistic approach, investigators can better determine the authenticity and relationships between digital images.
