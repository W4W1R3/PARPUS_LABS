## {1A} Connecting Two Computers Directly

Task: Connect two computers using a crossover cable.

Steps:

    • Assign static IP addresses to each computer.
    • Set a static IP address (e.g., 192.168.1.1) with subnet mask 255.255.255.0.
    • Verify connectivity using basic commands (ping).
    
# {1B} Connecting More Than Two Computers Using a Switch

Task: Set up a small network with three or more computers using a switch.

Steps:

    • Configure the switch.
    • Assign IP addresses using DHCP.
    • Test network connectivity.
    
# {1C} Connecting Two Networks Through a Router

Task: Introduce a router to connect two separate networks.

Steps:

    • Configure router interfaces.
    • Set up routing tables.
    • Test communication between devices on different networks.
    
# {1D} Setting Up Static and DHCP

Task: Understand the difference between static and dynamic IP assignment.

Steps:

    • Assign static IP addresses to devices in a network.
    • Enable DHCP on a server and configure clients to obtain IP dynamically.
    • Analyze the advantages and disadvantages of static vs. dynamic addressing.
